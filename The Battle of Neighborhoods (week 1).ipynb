    "##### Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem. This submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it."

    "#### **Scenario**\n",
    "##### I am a student of Computer Science branch from India. I want to work in Manhattan, NY. Although, I am very excited about it, I am a bit stress toward the process to secure a comparable place to live in Manhattan. Therefore, I decided to apply the learned skills during the Coursera course to explore ways to make sure my decision is factual and rewarding. Of course, there are alternatives to achieve the answer using available Google and Social media tools, but it rewarding doing it myself with learned tools."

    "1. Apartment with min 2 bedrooms with monthly rent not to exceed US$7000/month.  \n",
    "2. Unit located within walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km) from a subway metro station in Manhattan.  \n",

The use of FourSquare data and mapping techniques combined with data analysis will help resolve the key questions arisen. Lastly, this project is a good practical case toward the development of Data Science skills."

Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data. This submission will eventually become your Data section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Data section) to your Github repository and submit a link to it."
